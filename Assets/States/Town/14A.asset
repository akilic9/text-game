  storyText: "\tThe witcher approached Ostrit.\r\n\t\u201CPlease, you can\u2019t let
    her eat me.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhy? Didn\u2019t you just call me a vagabond, a brigand,
    a thug, a monster?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CPlease\u2026\u201D\r\n\tThe witcher pulled
    out his dagger.\r\n\t\u201CAre you expecting mercy from a monster?\u201D\r\n\tOstrit
    was silent.\n\tThe witcher cut the magnate\u2019s bonds. \u201CI\u2019ll let you
    go because I\u2019m not a monster. But you better be careful with your actions
    next time, dear lordship. Now run.\u201D\r\n\tOstrit didn\u2019t need a second
    command, he jumped up, numb, hobbled clumsily, and ran. His eyes had grown accustomed
    enough to the darkness for him to see his way from the main hall to the exit.\r\n\tSome
    time after the magnate left, the witcher heard the scrape of the tomb lid being
    moved aside. He heard the striga wandering outside her crypt. He stepped into
    the middle of the hall. By his count, there were about three hours left until
    dawn. The cock\u2019s crow could only mislead him. Besides, there were probably
    no cocks in the neighborhood.\r"
