  storyText: "CHAPTER 3\n\tGeralt looked out of the palace window for the last time.
    Dusk was falling rapidly. Beyond the lake the distant lights of Wyzim twinkled.
    There was a wilderness around the old palace\u2014a strip of no-man\u2019s land
    with which, over seven years, the town had cut itself off from this dangerous
    place, leaving nothing but a few ruins, rotten beams and the remains of a gap-toothed
    palisade which had obviously not been worth dismantling and moving. As far away
    as possible\u2014at the opposite end of the settlement\u2014the king had built
    his new residence. The stout tower of his new palace loomed black in the distance,
    against the darkening blue of the sky.\r\n\tIn one of the empty, plundered chambers,
    the witcher returned to the dusty table at which he was preparing, calmly and
    meticulously. He knew he had plenty of time. The striga would not leave her crypt
    before midnight. On the table in front of him he had a small chest with metal
    fittings. He opened it. Inside, packed tightly in compartments lined with dried
    grass, stood small vials of dark glass. The witcher removed three.\r\n\tFrom the
    floor, he picked up an oblong packet thickly wrapped in sheep\u2019s skins and
    fastened with a leather strap. He unwrapped it and pulled out a sword with an
    elaborate hilt, in a black, shiny scabbard covered with rows of runic signs and
    symbols. He drew the blade, which lit up with a pure shine of mirror-like brightness.
    It was pure silver.\r\n\tGeralt whispered an incantation and drank, one after
    the other, the contents of two vials, placing his left hand on the blade of the
    sword after each sip. Then, wrapping himself tightly in his black coat, he sat
    down on the floor. There were no chairs in the chamber, or in the rest of the
    palace. He sat motionless, his eyes closed. His breathing, at first even, suddenly
    quickened, became rasping and tense. And then stopped completely. The mixture
    which helped the witcher gain full control of his body was chiefly made up of
    veratrum, stramonium, hawthorn and spurge. The other ingredients had no name in
    any human language. For anyone who was not, like Geralt, inured to it from childhood,
    it would have been lethal poison.\r\n"
