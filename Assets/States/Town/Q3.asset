    replied Segelin, \u201Cif she attacks beyond the old palace. Within the palace

    out during the full moon, and not always then.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHas there been
    even one attack during the day?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CDoes she
    always devour her victims?\u201D\r\n\tVelerad spat vehemently on the straw.\r\n\t\u201CCome
