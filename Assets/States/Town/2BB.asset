  storyText: "\t\u201CMilk,\u201D said the stranger. His voice was unpleasant.\r\n\tThe
    innkeeper wiped his hands on his canvas apron and filled a chipped earthenware
    tankard.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m looking for a room for the night.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s
    none,\u201D grunted the innkeeper, looking at the guest\u2019s boots, dusty and
    dirty. \u201CAsk at The Fox.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI would rather stay here.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere
    is none.\u201D The innkeeper finally recognized the stranger\u2019s accent. He
    was Rivian.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll pay.\u201D The outsider spoke quietly, as if
    unsure, and the whole nasty affair began. The group of men at the table behind
    him that had not taken their eyes from the stranger since he entered got up. One
    of them approached the counter and stood next to the Rivian while others stood
    close.\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s no room to be had, you thug,\u201D rasped the pockmarked
    man, standing right next to the outsider. \u201CThis is a decent town! We don\u2019t
    need people like you here in Wyzim!\u201D the pockmarked man went on, his breath
    smelling of beer, garlic and anger. \u201CPay and leave!\u201D yelled the pockmarked
    man.\r\n\n\t1. \"I'll finish my milk.\"\n\t2. \"Fine.\""
