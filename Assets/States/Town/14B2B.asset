  storyText: "He reached to his sword and pulled it out from its sheath. He could
    try to save the princess but he didn\u2019t want to risk his life, what Velerad
    and the other offered was enough for him. The striga was still trying to free
    itself from the chain. He cut cleanly, separating its head from its body. Now
    he had to burn it, just to be sure. He put the body and the head in a crypt and
    started a fire using Igni. Once he was satisfied, he packed up his belongings
    and set out for Velerad\u2019s house.\r\nVelerad was awake, he looked at the witcher
    on his doorstep with anxious eyes.\r\n\u201CThe striga is taken care of, castellan.\u201D
    Said the witcher.\r\n\u201CGood- good job witcher. Thank you. You saved us from
    a big trouble. I was expecting you. We have your money ready.\u201D He went back
    in and took a purse from a drawer. \u201CHere.\u201D\r\n\tThe witcher opened the
    purse and counted quickly.\r\n\t\u201CYou better leave the town before Foltest
    learns, witcher.\u201D Said Velerad.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m leaving now, castellan.
    Goodbye.\u201D\r\n\tHe mounted his horse and rode out of town. By the time he
    was outside the city walls of Wyzim, he heard a cock, crowing.\r"
