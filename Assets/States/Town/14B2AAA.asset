  storyText: "\tWhen Geralt opened his eyes, the sand had passed through the hourglass.
    He pricked up his ears, and heard nothing. His senses were now functioning normally.\r\n\tHe
    took hold of his sword and, murmuring an incantation, ran his hand across the
    lid of the sarcophagus. He then moved the slab slightly, a couple of inches.\r\n\tSilence.\r\n\tHe
    pushed the lid further, sat, holding his weapon at the ready, and lifted his head
    above the tomb. The crypt was dark but the witcher knew that outside dawn was
    breaking. He struck a light, lit a miniature lamp and lifted it, throwing strange
    shadows across the walls of the crypt.\r\n\tIt was empty.\r\n\tHe scrambled from
    the sarcophagus, aching, numb, cold. And then he saw her. She was lying on her
    back next to the tomb, naked and unconscious.\r\n\tShe was rather ugly. Slim and
    dirty. Her hair\u2014 flaxen-red\u2014reached almost to her waist. Standing the
    lamp on the slab, he knelt beside her and leaned over. Her lips were pale and
    her face was bloody where he had hit her cheekbone. Geralt drew up her top lip
    with his finger. Her teeth were normal. He reached for her hand, which was buried
    in her tangled hair. Before he took it he saw her open eyes. Too late.\r"
