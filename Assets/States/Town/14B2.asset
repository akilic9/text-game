  storyText: "\tThe striga was in no hurry with her next attack. She approached slowly,
    baring her fangs, dribbling repulsively. Geralt backed away and, carefully placing
    his feet, traced a semi-circle. By slowing and quickening his movements he distracted
    the striga, making it difficult for her to leap. As he walked, the witcher unwound
    a long, strong silver chain, weighted at the end.\r\n\tThe moment the striga tensed
    and leapt the chain whistled through the air and, coiling like a snake, twined
    itself around the monster\u2019s shoulders, neck and head. The striga\u2019s jump
    became a tumble, and she let out an ear-piercing whistle. She thrashed around
    on the floor, howling horribly with fury or from the burning pain inflicted by
    the despised metal. Geralt was content\u2014if he wanted he could kill the striga
    without great difficulty.\n\n\t1. Kill her\n\t2. Try to save her"
