  storyText: "\tThe striga sprang up, shaking with uncontrolled anger and lust for
    murder. Geralt waited. He drew his sword, traced circles with it in the air, and
    skirted the striga, taking care that the movement of his sword was not in rhythm
    with his steps. She approached slowly, following the bright streak of the blade
    with her eyes. Geralt stopped abruptly, froze with his sword raised. The striga,
    disconcerted, also stopped. The witcher traced a slow semi-circle with the blade,
    took a step in the striga\u2019s direction. Then another. Then he leapt, feigning
    a whirling movement with his sword above her head. The striga curled up, retreated
    in a zigzag. Geralt was close again, the blade shimmering in his hand. His eyes
    lit up with an ominous glow, a hoarse roar tore through his clenched teeth. The
    striga backed away, pushed by the power of concentrated hatred, anger and violence
    which emanated from the attacking man and struck her in waves, penetrating her
    mind and body. Terrified and pained by feelings unknown to her she let out a thin,
    shaking squeak, turned on the spot and ran off in a desperate, crazy escape down
    the dark tangle of the palace\u2019s corridors.\r\n\tThis would give him a little
    more time until the beast recovered from the shock. The witcher doubted whether
    he could repeat such an effort. The elixirs were weakening and it was still a
    long time until dawn. But the striga could not return to her crypt before first
    light, or all his trouble would come to nothing.\r\n\tHe went down the stairs.
    The crypt was not large; there was room for three stone sarcophagi. The slab covering
    the first was half pushed aside. Geralt pulled the third vial from beneath his
    tunic, quickly drank its contents, climbed into the tomb and stretched out in
    it. As he had expected, it was a double tomb\u2014for mother and daughter.\r\n\tHe
    had only just pulled the cover closed when he heard the striga\u2019s roar again.
    He lay on his back next to Adda\u2019s mummified corpse and traced the Sign of
    Yrden on the inside of the slab. He laid his sword on his chest, stood a tiny
    hourglass filled with phosphorescent sand next to it and crossed his arms. He
    no longer heard the striga\u2019s screams as she searched the palace. He had gradually
    stopped hearing anything as the true-love and celandine began to work.\r"
