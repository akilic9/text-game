  storyText: "\tIt was full of people in the Old Narakort Inn. People who closed their
    stalls were having drinks and relaxing after a long day of work in the tavern.\r\n\tThe
    innkeeper raised his head above a barrel of pickled cucumbers and measured the
    man that entered with his gaze. The outsider, still in his coat, stood stiffly
    in front of the counter, motionless and silent.\r\n\tThe stranger was not old
    but his hair was almost entirely white. Beneath his coat he wore a worn leather
    jerkin laced up at the neck and shoulders.\r\n\tAs he took off his coat those
    around him noticed that he carried a sword\u2014 not something unusual in itself,
    nearly every man in Wyzim carried a weapon \u2014but no one carried a sword strapped
    to his back as if it were a bow or a quiver.\r\n\t\u201CWhat will it be?\u201D\r\n\n\t1.
    Beer\r\n\t2. Milk\r"
