  storyText: "\t\u201CAnd witchers? Have they tried?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere were a
    few. But when they heard the spell was to be lifted and the striga wasn\u2019t
    to be killed, they mostly shrugged and left. That\u2019s one of the reasons why
    my esteem for witchers has grown, Geralt. And one came along, younger than you
    \u2014 I forget his name, if he gave it at all. He tried. The fanged princess
    spread his entrails over a considerable distance.\u201D\r\n\tGeralt nodded. \u201CThat
    was all of them?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere was one other. At first, when Foltest
    threatened him with the noose if he killed or harmed the striga, he laughed and
    started packing his belongings. But then\u201D \u2014Velerad leaned across the
    table, lowered his voice to almost a whisper\u2014 \u201Cthen he undertook the
    task. You see, Geralt, there are some wise men in Wyzim, in high positions, who\u2019ve
    had enough of this whole affair. Rumor has it these men persuaded the witcher,
    in secret, not to fuss around with spells but to batter the striga to death and
    tell the king the spell had failed, that his dear daughter had been killed in
    self-defense \u2014 an accident at work. The king, of course, would be furious
    and refuse to pay an oren in reward. But that would be an end to it. The witty
    witcher replied we could chase strigas ourselves for nothing. Well, what could
    we do? We collected money, bargained\u2026 but nothing came of it. The witcher
    didn\u2019t want to try that first night. He trudged around, lay in wait, wandered
    about the neighborhood. Finally, they say, he saw the striga in action, as she
    does not clamber from her crypt just to stretch her legs. He saw her and scarpered
    that night. Without a word.\u201D\r\n\n\t1. \"About those wise men's offer...\""
