  storyText: "\tThe Rivian straightened. He quickly pinned his blade under his left
    arm and with his right hand raised toward the guards, swiftly drew a complicated
    sign in the air. The clout-nails which studded his tunic from his wrists to elbows
    flashed.\r\n\tThe guards drew back, shielding their faces with their arms. One
    of the customers sprang up while another darted to the door. The woman screamed
    again, wild and earsplitting.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll come by myself,\u201D repeated
    the stranger in his resounding, metallic voice. \u201CAnd the three of you will
    go in front of me. Take me to the castellan. I don\u2019t know the way.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes,
    sir,\u201D mumbled the guard, dropping his head. He made toward the exit, looking
    around tentatively. The other two guards followed him out backward, hastily. The
    stranger followed in their tracks, sheathing his sword and dagger. As they passed
    the tables the remaining customers hid their faces from the dangerous stranger.\r"
