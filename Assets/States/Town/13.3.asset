  storyText: "\t\u201CLord Ostrit, I do not care about politics, or the successions
    to thrones, or revolutions in palaces. I am here to accomplish my task. Have you
    never heard of a sense of responsibility and plain honesty? About professional
    ethics?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CCareful to whom you speak, you vagabond!\u201D Ostrit
    yelled furiously, placing his hand on the hilt of his sword. \u201CI have had
    enough of this. I am not accustomed to hold such discussions! Look at you\u2014ethics,
    codes of practice, morality?! Who are you to talk? A brigand who makes living
    by killing others? And you dare to turn your nose up at me, you serf? You mutated
    scum! You\u2019re not so different than those you kill, monster! Be gone before
    I run the flat of my sword across your gob!\u201D\r\n\tThe witcher did not stir.
    He stood calmly.\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019d better leave, Lord Ostrit,\u201D he said.
    \u201CIt\u2019s growing dark.\u201D\r\n\tOstrit took a step back, drew his sword
    in a flash.\r\n\t\u201CYou asked for this, you sorcerer. I\u2019ll kill you. Your
    tricks won\u2019t help you. I carry a turtle-stone.\u201D\r\n\tGeralt smiled.
    The reputation of turtle-stone was as mistaken as it was popular. But the witcher
    was not going to lose his strength on spells, much less expose his silver sword
    to contact with Ostrit\u2019s blade. He dived under the whirling blade and, with
    the heel of his hand and his silver-studded cuff, hit him in the temple.\r"
