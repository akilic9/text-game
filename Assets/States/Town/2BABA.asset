  storyText: "\t\u201CNo,\u201D said the outsider calmly as he raised his sword and
    dagger. \r\n\tThe remaining few customers ran off as the guards surrounded the
    stranger completely. Then the fight began.\n\tIt took way longer than it should
    have. By the end of it more than half the guards that first arrived were down
    on the floor, in various gruesome shapes. Even the innkeeper had abandoned the
    building at this point. The stranger was inhumanly fast and could cast spells.
    He burned some of the guards, bewitched a couple so that they attacked other guards
    and at one point threw everyone in a radius off their foot. But the guards kept
    coming, he was way outnumbered and surrounded. At the end he didn\u2019t even
    have room to maneuver, it took a few hits to the head but finally the guards took
    him down. The stranger fell to the ground, unconscious. Two guards held him by
    his arms and started dragging him, their destination was the dungeons.\r"
