  storyText: "\t\u201CMilk,\u201D said the stranger. His voice was unpleasant.\r\n\tThe
    innkeeper wiped his hands on his canvas apron and filled a chipped earthenware
    tankard.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m looking for a room for the night.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s
    none,\u201D grunted the innkeeper, looking at the guest\u2019s boots, dusty and
    dirty. \u201CAsk at the Old Narakort.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI would rather stay here.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere
    is none.\u201D The innkeeper finally recognized the stranger\u2019s accent. He
    was Rivian.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll pay.\u201D The outsider spoke quietly, as if
    unsure, and the whole nasty affair began. A pockmarked beanpole of a man who,
    from the moment the outsider had entered had not taken his gloomy eyes from him,
    got up and approached the counter. Two of his companions rose behind him, no more
    than two paces away.\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s no room to be had, you thug,\u201D
    rasped the pockmarked man, standing right next to the outsider. \u201CThis is
    a decent town!\u201D the pockmarked man went on, his breath smelling of beer,
    garlic and anger. \u201CPay and leave!\u201D yelled the pocked man.\r\n\n\t1.
    \"I'll finish my milk.\"\n\t2. \"Fine.\"\n\t3. (Use Axii)"
