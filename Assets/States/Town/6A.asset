  storyText: "\tThe stranger threw the dagger to the guard named Treska in a flash.
    He then took a big step towards the second guard, the guard raised his sword to
    strike the stranger, but the stranger was inhumanly fast. He dodged the guard\u2019s
    strike easily and threw him off balance. He took a step back and struck a mighty
    blow, the guard managed to parry the blow but before he could recover from the
    impact it made the stranger struck another blow. The guard was too late for this
    one, stranger\u2019s sword slashed through his chest and he fell down with a scream,
    creating a small lake of blood on floor.\r\n\tA couple more of the remaining customers
    ran towards the exit, stumbling on their way to the door, they fell down once
    or twice but they got up and kept running without turning back. There was only
    the stranger, the last guard, the innkeeper and the previously screaming woman
    left now. She had finally lost her voice, she was crouched behind a table, frozen.
    The innkeeper, still behind the counter, was white as chalk, he looked as if he
    was about to get sick again.\r\n\tThe last guard attacked the stranger with his
    sword, the stranger parried the blow, hit the guard\u2019s knee and swung his
    sword through the guard\u2019s neck. There was a moment of silence, then the guard\u2019s
    head dropped to the floor, followed by the rest of his body. And then silence
    again, before the innkeeper started vomiting for the second time.\r"
