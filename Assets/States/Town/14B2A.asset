  storyText: "\tBut the witcher did not draw his sword. Nothing in the striga\u2019s
    behavior had given him reason to think she might be an incurable case. Geralt
    moved to a safer distance and, without letting the writhing shape on the floor
    out of his sight, breathed deeply, focused himself.\r\n\tThe chain snapped. The
    silver links scattered like rain in all directions, ringing against the stone.
    The striga, blind with fury, tumbled to the attack, roaring. Geralt waited calmly
    and, with his raised right hand, traced the Sign of Aard in front of him.\r\n\tThe
    striga fell back as if hit by a mallet but kept her feet, extended her talons,
    bared her fangs. Her hair stood on end and fluttered as if she were walking against
    a fierce wind. With difficulty, one rasping step at a time, she slowly advanced.
    But she did advance.He lowered the Sign suddenly, and sprung aside. The striga,
    taken by surprise, flew forward, lost her balance, fell, slid along the floor
    and tumbled down the stairs into the crypt\u2019s entrance, yawning in the floor.\r\n\tHer
    infernal scream reverberated from below.\r\n\tTo gain time Geralt jumped on to
    the stairs leading to the gallery. He had not even climbed halfway up when the
    striga ran out of the crypt, speeding along like an enormous black spider. The
    witcher waited until she had run up the stairs after him, then leapt over the
    balustrade. The striga turned on the stairs, sprang and flew at him in an amazing
    ten-meter leap. Twice her talons left their mark on the Rivian\u2019s leather
    tunic. But another desperately hard blow from the silver spiked gauntlet threw
    the striga aside, shook her. Geralt, feeling fury building inside him, swayed,
    bent backward and, with a mighty kick, knocked the beast off her legs.\r\n\tThe
    roar she gave was louder than all the previous ones. Even the plaster crumbled
    from the ceiling.\r"
