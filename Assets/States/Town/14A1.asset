  storyText: "\tHe heard her. She was trudging slowly, shuffling along the floor.
    And then he saw her.\r\n\tThe description had been accurate. The disproportionately
    large head set on a short neck was surrounded by a tangled, curly halo of reddish
    hair. Her eyes shone in the darkness like an animal\u2019s. The striga stood motionless,
    her gaze fixed on Geralt. Suddenly she opened her jaws\u2014as if proud of her
    rows of pointed white teeth\u2014then snapped them shut with a crack like a chest
    being closed. And leapt, slashing at the witcher with her bloodied claws.\r\n\tGeralt
    dodged the attack. The striga rubbed against him, spun around, slicing through
    the air with her talons. She didn\u2019t lose her balance and attacked anew, gnashing
    her teeth fractions of an inch from Geralt\u2019s chest. The Rivian jumped away,
    changing the direction of his spin to confuse the striga. As he leapt away he
    dealt a hard blow to the side of her head with the silver spikes studding the
    knuckles of his gauntlet.\r\n\tThe striga roared horribly, filling the palace
    with a booming echo, fell to the ground, froze and started to howl hollowly and
    furiously.\r\n\tSilver was fatal to the striga, as it was for most monsters brought
    into existence through magic. So there was a chance: the beast was like the others,
    and that boded well for lifting the spell, while the silver sword would, as a
    last resort, assure his life.\r"
