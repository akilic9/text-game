  storyText: "\tThe following day, the miller who survived striga\u2019s attack was
    brought to the witcher. He was led in by a soldier in a hooded coat.\r\n\tThe
    conversation did not yield any significant results. The miller was terrified,
    his scars told the witcher more than he did. The striga could open her jaws impressively
    wide and had extremely sharp teeth. Her claws were sharper than a wildcat\u2019s,
    but less curved. And it was only because of that the miller had managed to tear
    himself away.\r\n\tHaving finished his examination Geralt dismissed them. The
    soldier pushed the peasant through the door and lowered his hood. It was Foltest
    himself.\r\n\t\u201CWhen will you set about your task?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CIt is
    four days until the full moon. After that. Having had her fill the\u2014the princess
    will be less active.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CStriga, master witcher, striga. Let us not
    play at diplomacy. She will be a princess afterwards. Answer me unofficially,
    briefly and clearly: will it work or not?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI confirm, your Majesty,
    that the spell might be reversed. Unless I am mistaken, it can be done by spending
    the night at the palace. The third crowing of the cock, as long as it catches
    the striga outside her sarcophagus, will end the spell. But there are also cases
    which are\u2026 well\u2026 hopeless.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes,\u201D Foltest bristled.
    \u201CI keep hearing that. Kill the monster because it\u2019s an incurable case.
    I am sure they have already spoken to you. Hack the man-eater to death without
    any more fuss, at the beginning, and tell the king nothing else could be done.
    I won\u2019t pay, but they will. Very convenient. Because the king will order
    the witcher beheaded or hanged and the gold will remain in their pockets.\u201D\r\n\tGeralt
    was silent for a moment. \u201CI intend to do what is in my power,\u201D he said.
    \u201CBut if it goes badly I will defend my life. Your Majesty, you must also
    be prepared for such an eventuality.\u201D\r\n\tFoltest got up. \u201CYou do not
    understand me. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ll kill her if it becomes necessary,
    whether I like it or not. I won\u2019t punish anyone who kills her in self-defense.
    But I will not allow her to be killed without trying to save her. After the third
    crowing of the cock, what will there be?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CIf all goes well, a
    fourteen-year-old girl.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWith red eyes? Crocodile\u2019s teeth?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CA
    normal fourteen-year-old. Physically.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI see. And mentally? Every
    day, a bucket of blood for breakfast? A little girl\u2019s thigh?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo.
    Mentally\u2026 There is no telling. On the level, I think, of a three- or four-year-old
    child. She\u2019ll require loving care for a long while.\u201D \r\n"
