  storyText: "\tShe swiped him across the neck with her talons, cutting him deeply.
    Blood splashed onto her face. She howled, striking him in the eyes with her other
    hand. He fell on her, grabbing her by the wrists, nailing her to the floor. She
    gnashed her teeth\u2014which were now too short\u2014in front of his face. He
    butted her in the face with his forehead and pinned her down harder. She had lost
    her former strength; she could only writhe beneath him, howling, spitting out
    blood\u2014his blood\u2014which was pouring over her mouth. His blood was draining
    away quickly. There was no time. The witcher cursed and bit her hard on the neck,
    just below the ear. He dug his teeth in and clenched them until her inhuman howling
    became a thin, despairing scream and then a choking sob\u2014the cry of a hurt
    fourteen-year-old girl.\r\n\tHe let her go when she stopped moving, got to his
    knees, tore a piece of canvas from his sleeve pocket and pressed it to his neck.
    He felt for his sword, held the blade to the unconscious girl\u2019s throat, and
    leaned over her hand. The nails were dirty, broken, bloodied but\u2026 normal.
    Completely normal.\r\n\tThe witcher got up with difficulty. The sticky-wet grayness
    of early morning was flooding in through the crypt\u2019s entrance. He made a
    move toward the stairs but staggered and sat down heavily on the floor. Blood
    was pouring through the drenched canvas onto his hands, running down his sleeve.
    He unfastened his tunic, slit his shirt, tore and ripped rags from it and tied
    them around his neck, knowing that he didn\u2019t have much time, that he would
    soon faint\u2026\r\n\tHe succeeded. And fainted.\r\n\tIn Wyzim, beyond the lake,
    a cock, ruffling his feathers in the cold damp, crowed hoarsely for the third
    time.\r"
