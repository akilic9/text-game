  storyText: "\tOnly now did he Rivian turned around and took a look at the pocked
    man. He silently watched the man for a moment. The whole inn was silent. Every
    guest had turned their attention to the two men in front of the counter, all eyes
    were curiously watching the stranger and the pockmarked man.\r\n\t\u201CFine,\u201D
    said the Rivian finally. He turned to the innkeeper. \u201CWhich way to the Castellan?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CDown
    the\u2026\u201D\r\n\t\u201CDid you not hear what I said, you thug?\u201D started
    the pockmarked man again. \u201CPay and leave! We don\u2019t want you here! All
    Rivians are thieves!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHe can\u2019t hear you. His ears are full
    of shit,\u201D said one of the men with him, and the second man cackled.\r\n\tThe
    Rivian turned to the pocked man again. His hand clenched around his tankard. Took
    another long look at him and his companions. He sighed and turned back to the
    innkeeper, put his tankard down, pulled out his purse and paid the innkeeper for
    his drink.\r\nHe turned to the door and started walking.\r\n\t\u201CYeah you better
    leave,\u201D said the pocked man, his companions laughing like hyenas behind him
    as the Rivian left the tavern.\r"
