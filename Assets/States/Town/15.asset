  storyText: "\tHe saw the whitened walls and beamed ceiling of the small chamber
    above the guardroom. He moved his head, grimacing with pain, and moaned. His neck
    was bandaged, thickly, thoroughly, professionally.\r\n\t\u201CLie still, witcher,\u201D
    said Velerad. \u201CLie, do not move.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CMy\u2026 sword\u2026\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes,
    yes. Of course, what is most important is your witcher\u2019s silver sword. It\u2019s
    here, don\u2019t worry. Both the sword and your little trunk. And your reward.
    Yes, yes, don\u2019t utter a word. It is I who am an old fool and you the wise
    witcher. Foltest has been repeating it over and over for the last two days.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CTwo\u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201COh
    yes, two. She slit your neck open quite thoroughly. One could see everything you
    have inside there. You lost a great deal of blood. Fortunately we hurried to the
    palace straight after the third crowing of the cock. Nobody slept in Wyzim that
    night. It was impossible; you made a terrible noise. Does my talking tire you?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThe
    prin\u2026 cess?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThe princess is like a princess. Thin. And somewhat
    dull-witted. She weeps incessantly and wets her bed. But Foltest says this will
    change. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change for the worse, do you, Geralt?\u201D\r\n\tThe
    witcher closed his eyes.\r\n\t\u201CGood. I take my leave now. Rest.\u201D Velerad
    got up. \u201CGeralt? Before I go, tell me: why did you try to bite her to death?
    Eh? Geralt?\u201D\r\n\tThe witcher was asleep.\r"
