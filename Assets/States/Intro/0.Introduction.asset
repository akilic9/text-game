    stages you\u2019ll be given options. To choose an option, push the number of
    the option you want to select on your keyboard.If there are no options you can
    pass to the next stage by pressing 1.\n\tAt any point you can quit by pressing
    the key \u201CQ\u201D.\n\tThe choices you make can have consequences.\r\n\tThere\u2019s
    some information about the game's world and protagonist below. It is recommended
    that you read it if you are unfamiliar with Witcher games or book series.\n\r\n\tThe
    Witcher is not a person, but rather a profession. To put it simply, they're monster
    hunters. The Continent, the land where the Witcher takes place, has a variety
    of beasts and ghouls. Some notable examples include the walking spirit of a forest
    called the leshen that's made up of plants, animal pelts and skulls, and the
    bruxa, a powerful female vampire who has a deafening scream. \r\n\tWitchers are
    trained to dispose of these monsters using a variety of tools and weapons at
    their disposal. Their most useful is their silver swords because the metal is
    usually the most effective against unholy beasts. They also have a selection
    of simple magic spells called Signs that can be cast using a particular sign
    with their hands. Some commonly used are the telekinetic push Aard, the hypnotic
    effect Axii and the fire spell Igni. Witchers can use Signs quickly in a battle
    at the expense of a bit of their own endurance. \r\n\tOne of the most important
    Witcher tools is a silver medallion. These magical neckpieces vibrate when monsters
    are nearby or if magic is being used, which makes them invaluable to a monster
    hunter.\r\n\tWitchers are not born, they're made. Orphaned kids make up many
    of the monster hunters, and they're trained at schools located in different parts
    of the world.\r\n\tThose training to become a Witcher learn magic, bestiary,
    weapons and herbalism. Once ready, a student will partake in a Trial of the Grasses.
    This process is what gives a Witcher several physical advantages such as improved
    healing, the ability to see in the dark and supernatural strength. The trial
    is painful and dangerous with most kids dying in the process.\n\tA student becomes
    a full-fledged Witcher once the trials are over. They will then travel across
    the land hunting monsters for money.\n\n>>>Press 1 to start."
