  storyText: "\t\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\tOstrit did not hear the scrape of the tomb lid
    being moved aside, but the witcher did. He leaned over and, with his dagger, cut
    the magnate\u2019s bonds. Ostrit did not wait, for the word. He jumped up, numb,
    hobbled clumsily, and ran. His eyes had grown accustomed enough to the darkness
    for him to see his way from the main hall to the exit.\r\n\tThe slab blocking
    the entrance to the crypt opened and fell to the floor with a thud. Geralt, prudently
    behind the staircase balustrade, saw the misshapen figure of the striga speeding
    swiftly and unerringly in the direction of Ostrit\u2019s receding footsteps. Not
    the slightest sound issued from the striga. A terrible, quivering, frenzied scream
    tore the night, shook the old walls, continued rising and falling, vibrating.
    The witcher couldn\u2019t make out exactly how far away it was\u2014his sharpened
    hearing deceived him\u2014but he knew that the striga had caught up with Ostrit
    quickly. Too quickly.\r\n\tHe stepped into the middle of the hall, stood right
    at the entrance to the crypt. He still had some time. He knew that the striga,
    although well fed after the last full moon, would not readily abandon Ostrit\u2019s
    corpse. The heart and liver were, for her, valuable reserves of nutrition for
    the long periods spent in lethargic sleep.\r\n\tThe witcher waited. By his count,
    there were about three hours left until dawn. The cock\u2019s crow could only
    mislead him. Besides, there were probably no cocks in the neighborhood.\r\n"
