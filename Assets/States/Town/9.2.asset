  storyText: "\tFoltest was slim and had a pretty\u2014too pretty\u2014face. He was
    under forty, the witcher thought. The king was sitting on a dwarf-armchair carved
    from black wood, his legs stretched out toward the hearth, where two dogs were
    warming themselves. Next to him on a chest sat an older, powerfully built man
    with a beard. Behind the king stood another man, richly dressed and with a proud
    look on his face. A magnate.\r\n\t\u201CVelerad!\u201D He said. \u201CHave you
    given him the details?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes, your Gracious Majesty. He says the
    spell cast on the princess can be reversed.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI have known that
    for a long time. I will make one small comment. Several witchers have been here
    already. I know that your speciality is to kill, rather than to reverse spells.
    This isn\u2019t an option. If one hair falls from my daughter\u2019s head, your
    head will be on the block. That is all. Ostrit, Lord Segelen, stay and give him
    all the information he requires. Witchers always ask a lot of questions. Feed
    him and let him stay in the palace. He is not to drift from tavern to tavern.\u201D
    \r\n\tThe king rose, whistled to his dogs and made his way to the door, scattering
    the straw covering the chamber floor. At the door he paused.\r\n\t\u201CIf you
    succeed, witcher, the reward is yours. Maybe I will add something if you do well.
    Of course, the nonsense spread by common folk about marrying the princess carries
    not a word of truth. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t believe I would give my daughter\u2019s
    hand to a stranger?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo, your Majesty. I don\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CGood.
    That shows you have some wisdom.\u201D\r\n\tFoltest left, closing the door behind
    him. Segelin, the bearded man, nodded at Geralt.\r\n\t\u201CWhat would you like
    to know, witcher?\u201D\r\n\n\t1. \"Did the sorcerers think the spell could be
    lifted?\"\n\t2. \"Describe the striga.\"\n\t3. \"Time of her attacks...\"\n\t4.
    \"Anyone survived an attack?\"\n\t5. \"Other witchers?\"\n\t6. >Skip to the next
    chapter"
