  storyText: "CHAPTER 2\r\n\t\u201CI am Velerad, castellan of Wyzim, what did you
    want to talk about?\u201D\r\n\tThe Rivian unbuttoned his jerkin and pulled out
    a wad of white goat leather. \u201CYou nail this crossways, in taverns,\u201D
    he said quietly. \u201CIs what\u2019s written here true?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CAh.\u201D
    Velerad grunted, looking at the runes etched into the leather. \u201CSo that\u2019s
    it. And I didn\u2019t guess at once. Yes, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s signed by
    Foltest, King of Temeria, Pontar and Mahakam, which makes it true. You carry the
    witcher\u2019s emblem?\u201D The stranger pulled out a round medallion on a silver
    chain. It pictured the head of a wolf, baring its fangs. \u201CAnd do you have
    a name? Any name will do, it\u2019s simply to make conversation easier.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CMy
    name is Geralt.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CRight. Do you know what, Geralt? This\u201D \u2014
    Velerad slapped the proclamation \u2014 \u201Clet it go. It\u2019s a serious matter.
    Many have tried and failed already. This, my friend, is not the same as roughing
    up a couple of scoundrels.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI know. This is my job, Velerad. And
    that proclamation offers a three thousand oren reward.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThree
    thousand.\u201D Velerad scowled. \u201CAnd the princess as a wife, or so rumor
    says, although gracious Foltest has not proclaimed that.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
    not interested in the princess,\u201D Geralt said calmly. He was sitting motionless,
    his hands on his knees. \u201CJust in the three thousand. Do you know the details?\u201D\r"
