  storyText: "\tOnly now did the Rivian look at him.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll finish my
    milk.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWe\u2019ll give you a hand,\u201D the pockmarked man hissed.
    He knocked the tankard from the stranger\u2019s hand and simultaneously grabbing
    him by the shoulder, dug his fingers into the leather strap which ran diagonally
    across the outsider\u2019s chest. One of the men behind him raised a fist to strike.
    The outsider curled up on the spot, throwing the pockmarked man off balance. The
    sword hissed in its sheath and glistened briefly in the dim light. The place seethed.
    There was a scream, and one of the few remaining customers tumbled toward the
    exit. A chair fell with a crash and earthenware smacked hollowly against the floor.
    The innkeeper, his lips trembling, looked at the horribly slashed face of the
    pocked man, who, clinging with his fingers to the edge of the counter, was slowly
    sinking from sight. The other two were lying on the floor, one motionless, the
    other writhing and convulsing in a dark, spreading puddle. A woman\u2019s hysterical
    scream vibrated in the air, piercing the ears as the innkeeper shuddered, caught
    his breath, and vomited.\r\n\tThree guards rushed into the tavern with thuds and
    clangs. They must have been close by. They had truncheons wound with leather straps
    at the ready, but at the sight of the corpses, drew their swords. The Rivian pressed
    his back against the wall and, with his left hand, pulled a dagger from his boot.\r\n\t\u201CThrow
    that down!\u201D one of the guards yelled with a trembling voice. \u201CThrow
    that down, you thug! You\u2019re coming with us!\u201D\r\n\tThe second guard kicked
    aside the table between himself and the Rivian.\r\n\t\u201CGo get the men, Treska!\u201D
    he shouted to the third guard, who had stayed closer to the door.\r\n\t\u201CNo
    need,\u201D said the stranger, lowering his sword. \u201CI\u2019ll come by myself.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019ll
    go, you son of a bitch, on the end of a rope!\u201D yelled the trembling guard.
    \u201CThrow that sword down or I\u2019ll smash your head in!\u201D\r\n\n\t1. Fight
    the guards\n\t2. Use Axii"
