  storyText: "\tThe striga was in no hurry with her next attack. She approached slowly,
    baring her fangs, dribbling repulsively. Geralt backed away and, carefully placing
    his feet, traced a semi-circle. By slowing and quickening his movements he distracted
    the striga, making it difficult for her to leap. As he walked, the witcher unwound
    a long, strong silver chain, weighted at the end.\r\n\tThe moment the striga tensed
    and leapt the chain whistled through the air and, coiling like a snake, twined
    itself around the monster\u2019s shoulders, neck and head. The striga\u2019s jump
    became a tumble, and she let out an ear-piercing whistle. She thrashed around
    on the floor, howling horribly with fury or from the burning pain inflicted by
    the despised metal. The chain snapped. The silver links scattered like rain in
    all directions, ringing against the stone. The striga, blind with fury, tumbled
    to the attack, roaring. Geralt waited calmly and, with his raised right hand,
    traced the Sign of Aard in front of him.\r\n\tThe striga fell back as if hit by
    a mallet but kept her feet, extended her talons, bared her fangs. Her hair stood
    on end and fluttered as if she were walking against a fierce wind. With difficulty,
    one rasping step at a time, she slowly advanced. But she did advance.\r\n\tGeralt
    grew uneasy. He did not expect such a simple Sign to paralyze the striga entirely
    but neither did he expect the beast to overcome it so easily. He could not hold
    the Sign for long, it was too exhausting, and the striga had no more than ten
    steps to go. He lowered the Sign suddenly, and sprung aside. The striga, taken
    by surprise, flew forward, lost her balance, fell, slid along the floor and tumbled
    down the stairs into the crypt\u2019s entrance, yawning in the floor.\r\n\tHer
    infernal scream reverberated from below.\r\n"
