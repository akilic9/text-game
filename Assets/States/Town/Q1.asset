  storyText: "\t\u201CThe castellan said that, after the striga\u2019s appearance,
    the king called up many Knowing Ones. Were they in agreement that the spell can
    be lifted?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CDon\u2019t say striga, say princess. It makes it easier
    to avoid making a mistake in the king\u2019s presence\u2014and any consequent
    unpleasantness. They were far from any agreement\u201D \u2014Segelin smiled\u2014
    \u201Con any subject. But such an opinion was expressed. It was supposed to be
    simple, not even requiring magical abilities. As I understand it, it would suffice
    for someone to spend the night\u2014from sunset to the third crowing of the cock\u2014by
    the sarcophagus.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSimple indeed,\u201D snorted Velerad.\r\n\n\t1.
