  storyText: "\tOnly now did the Rivian look at him.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll finish my
    milk.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWe\u2019ll give you a hand,\u201D the pockmarked man hissed.
    The pockmarked man raised his fist to hit the stranger but the Rivian was quicker
    than him. He drew a complicated sign in the air with his right hand. The clout-nail
    which studded his tunic from his wrists to elbows flashed.\r\n\tThe pockmarked
    man and his two companions drew back, shielding their faces with their arms. The
    customers gasped and froze in their places from fear.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll finish
    my milk,\u201D said the Rivian. \u201CAnd you three, will sit peacefully.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes,
    sir,\u201D mumbled the pockmarked man, dropping his head. They walked back to
    their table under the gaze of surprised and scared guests, and got back to drinking
    silently.\r\n\tThe Rivian turned back to the innkeeper.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll go
    prepare your room,\u201D mumbled the innkeeper.\r"
