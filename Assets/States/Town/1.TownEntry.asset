  storyText: "CHAPTER 1\n\tLater, it was said that the man came from the north, from
    Ropers Gate. He came on foot, leading his laden horse by the bridle. It was late
    afternoon and the ropers', saddlers' and tanners' stalls were already closed,
    the street empty. It was hot but the man had a black coat thrown over his shoulders.
    \r\n\tHe stopped in front of the Old Narakort Inn, listened the hubbub of the
    voices. As usual, at this hour, it was full of people.\r\n\tDown the street was
    another tavern, a smaller one, called The Fox. Not enjoying the best of reputations,
    it was almost empty.\r\n\tHe stood on the street for a moment to decide where
    to go.\r\n\n\t1. Old Narakort Inn\r\n\t2. The Fox\r"
