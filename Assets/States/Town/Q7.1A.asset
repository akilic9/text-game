  storyText: "\t\u201CCastellan,\u201D said Geralt, \u201Cwhy act in haste? After
    all, I really could have an accident at work, irrespective of my intentions. Just
    in case, the wise men should be thinking about how to save me from the king\u2019s
    anger and get those thousand orens, of which rumor speaks, ready.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CIt
    was to be eight hundred.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo, my dear lords,\u201D the witcher
    said categorically. \u201CThe witcher who was offered eight hundred ran at the
    mere sight of the striga, without bargaining. So the risk is greater eight hundred.
    Whether it is greater than a thousand remains to be seen. Of course, I will say
    goodbye beforehand.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CGeralt?\u201D Velerad scratched his head.
    \u201COne thousand? That is simply too much.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo. This isn\u2019t
    an easy task. If it was easy, one of my predecessors would have solved the problem.
    You think they let themselves be devoured out of fear of the king?\u201D\r\n\tThe
    wise men looked at each other, then Segelin shrugged. \u201CAll right then, witcher,
    one thousand it is. Do we have an agreement?\u201D\r\n\n\t1. Accept\n\t2. Refuse"
