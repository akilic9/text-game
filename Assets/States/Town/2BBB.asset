  storyText: "\tOnly now did he Rivian turned around and took a look at the pocked
    man. \r\nThe whole inn was silent. Every guest had turned their attention to the
    two men in front of the counter, all eyes were curiously watching the stranger
    and the pockmarked man.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll finish my milk.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWe\u2019ll
    give you a hand,\u201D the pockmarked man hissed. He knocked the tankard from
    the stranger\u2019s hand and simultaneously grabbing him by the shoulder, dug
    his fingers into the leather strap which ran diagonally across the outsider\u2019s
    chest. One of the men behind him raised a fist to strike. The outsider curled
    up on the spot, throwing the pockmarked man off balance. The sword hissed in its
    sheath and glistened briefly in the dim light. The place seethed. There were lots
    of screaming and a stampede as most of the customers ran for the exit. Chairs
    and earthenware smacked against the floor. The tavern looked like a battlefield.
    The innkeeper, his lips trembling, looked at the horribly slashed face of the
    pocked man, who, clinging with his finger to the edge of the counter, was slowly
    sinking from sight. One of his friends were lying on the floor motionless, two
    others writhing and convulsing in a dark spreading puddle. The last one was headfirst
    down the trashcan, he wasn\u2019t moving. There were still screams in the air,
    the innkeeper shuddered, caught his breath, and vomited.\r\n\tAt least a dozen
    guards came rushing with thuds and clangs. The escaped customers must have told
    them about the little incident. Some of them had their swords drawn while some
    pointed their spears to the outsider. The Rivian pressed his back to against the
    wall and, with his left hand, pulled a dagger from his boot.\r\n\t\u201CThrow
    that down!\u201D yelled the captain of the guards. \u201CThrow that down, you
    thug! You\u2019re coming with us!\u201D\r\n\tThe other guards with spears were
    advancing towards the stranger, as more guards came in as reinforcements.\r\n\n\t1.
    Fight the guards\n\t2. Surrender\n"
