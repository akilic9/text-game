  storyText: "CHAPTER 2\n\tVelerad, castellan of Wyzim, scratched his chin. He wasn\u2019t
    faint hearted but he did not relish the thought of being alone with the white-haired
    man. At last he made up his mind.\r\n\t\u201CLeave,\u201D he ordered the guards
    that dragged the prisoner into his room. \u201CI am Velerad, castellan of Wyzim,\u201D
    he started once the guards left. \u201CWhat is it that you want to say to me,
    you brigand? This better be good, otherwise you\u2019re going back to dungeon
    and will only come out again to meet the noose.\u201D\r\nThe stranger pulled out
    a round medallion on a silver chain and a wad of white goat leather that he showed
    to the castellan. The medallion pictured the head of a wolf, baring its fangs.
    Velerad looked at the medallion then read the runes etched into the leather. \r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
    a witcher. Is what\u2019s written here true?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CAh.\u201D Velerad
    grunted, \u201CSo that\u2019s it. And I didn\u2019t guess at once. Yes, it\u2019s
    true. It\u2019s signed by Foltest, King of Temeria, Pontar and Mahakam. A proclamation
    is a proclamation, witcher, but law is law \u2014 and I take care of law and order
    in Wyzim. I will not allow people to be murdered! Do you understand?\u201D\r\n\tThe
    Rivian nodded to show he understood. Velerad snorted with anger.\r\n\tDo you have
    a name? Any name will do, it\u2019s simply to make conversation easier.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CMy
    name is Geralt.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CRight. Do you know what, Geralt? This\u201D \u2014
    Velerad slapped the proclamation \u2014 \u201Clet it go. It\u2019s a serious matter.
    Many have tried and failed already. This, my friend, is not the same as roughing
    up a couple of scoundrels.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI know. This is my job, Velerad. And
    that proclamation offers a three thousand oren reward.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThree
    thousand.\u201D Velerad scowled. \u201CAnd the princess as a wife, or so rumor
    says, although gracious Foltest has not proclaimed that.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
    not interested in the princess,\u201D Geralt said calmly. He was sitting motionless,
    his hands on his knees. \u201CJust in the three thousand. Do you know the details?\u201D\r"
