  storyText: "\tThe witcher turned his head abruptly. In the silence his hearing,
    sharpened beyond measure, easily picked out a rustle of footsteps through the
    courtyard overgrown with stinging nettles. It could not be the striga. The steps
    were too light. Geralt threw his sword across his back, hid his bundle in the
    hearth of the ruined chimney-place and, silent as a bat, ran downstairs.\r\n\tIt
    was still light enough in the courtyard for the approaching man to see the witcher\u2019s
    face. The man, Ostrit, backed away abruptly; an involuntary grimace of terror
    and repulsion contorted his lips. The witcher smiled wryly \u2014he knew what
    he looked like. After drinking a mixture of banewart, monk\u2019s hood and eyebright
    the face takes on the color of chalk, and the pupils fill the entire iris. But
    the mixture enables one to see in the deepest darkness, and this is what Geralt
    wanted.\r\n\t\u201CYou look as if you were already a corpse, witcher,\u201D he
    said. \u201CFrom fear, no doubt. Don\u2019t be afraid. I bring you reprieve.\u201D\r\n\tThe
    witcher did not reply.\r\n\t\u201CDon\u2019t you hear what I say, you Rivian charlatan?
    You\u2019re saved. And rich.\u201D Ostrit hefted a sizeable purse in his hand
    and threw it at Geralt\u2019s feet. \u201CA thousand orens. Take it, get on your
    horse and get out of here!\u201D\r\n\tThe Rivian still said nothing.\r\n\t\u201CDon\u2019t
    gawp at me!\u201D Ostrit raised his voice. \u201CAnd don\u2019t waste my time.
    I have no intention of standing here until midnight. Don\u2019t you understand?
    I do not wish you to undo the spell. No, you haven\u2019t guessed. I am not in
    league with Velerad and Segelin. I don\u2019t want you to kill her. You are simply
    to leave. Everything is to stay as it is.\u201D\r\n\n\t1. \"Why?\"\n\t2. (Accept
    the offer)\n\t3. (Refuse the offer)"
