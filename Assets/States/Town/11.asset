  storyText: "\t\u201CCan it happen to her again? Later on?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CShould
    she die after a long swoon lasting several days, her body will have to be burned.
    Quickly.\u201D\r\n\tFoltest grew gloomy.\r\n\t\u201CI do not think it will come
    to that,\u201D added Geralt. \u201CJust to be sure, I will give you some instructions,
    your Majesty, to lessen the danger. This is a serious matter, your Majesty. That
    is why you must listen: the princess should always wear a sapphire around her
    neck, or better, an inclusion, on a silver chain. Day and night.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhat
    is an inclusion?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CA sapphire with a pocket of air trapped within
    the stone. Aside from that, every now and then you should burn juniper, broom
    and aspen in the fireplace of her chamber.\u201D\r\n\tFoltest grew pensive. \u201CI
    thank you for your advice, witcher. I will pay heed if\u2014And now listen to
    me carefully. If you find the case is hopeless, kill her. If you undo the spell
    but the girl is not\u2026 normal. If you have a shadow of a doubt as to whether
    you have been entirely successful, kill her. Do not worry, you have nothing to
    fear from me. I\u2019ll shout at you in front of others, banish you from the palace
    and the town, nothing more, Of course I won\u2019t give you the reward, but maybe
    you\u2019ll manage to negotiate something from you know who.\u201D\r\n\tThey were
    both quiet for a while.\r\n\t\u201CGeralt.\u201D For the first time Foltest called
    the witcher by his name. \u201CHow much truth is there in the rumor that the child
    is as she is because Adda was my sister?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNot much. A spell has
    to be cast, they don\u2019t cast themselves. But I think your congress with your
    sister was the reason the spell was cast, and this is the result.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou
    inspire trust,\u201D he said, \u201Calthough I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never know
    whether you are going there to save my daughter, or to kill her. But I agree to
    it. I have to agree. Do you know why?\u201D\r\n\tGeralt did not reply.\r\n\t\u201CBecause
    I think,\u201D said the king, \u201CI think that she is suffering. Am I not right?\u201D\r\n\tThe
    witcher fixed his penetrating eyes on the king. He didn\u2019t confirm it, didn\u2019t
    nod, didn\u2019t make the slightest gesture, but Foltest knew. He knew the answer.\r\n"
