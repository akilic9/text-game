  storyText: "\tOstrit quickly regained consciousness and looked around in the total
    darkness. He noticed that he was tied up. He did not see Geralt standing right
    beside him. But he realized where he was and let out a prolonged, terrifying howl.\r\n\t\u201CKeep
    quiet,\u201D said the witcher. \u201COtherwise you\u2019ll lure her out before
    her time.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019re leaving me here to be devoured by her!
    Tied up?\u201D he asked, quieter now, whispering a vile invective.\r\n\t\u201CNo,\u201D
    said the witcher. \u201CI\u2019ll let you go. But not now.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou
    scoundrel,\u201D hissed Ostrit. \u201CTo distract the striga?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\t\u201C\u2026Witcher?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYes?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s
    true that I wanted to overthrow Foltest. I\u2019m not the only one. But I am the
    only one who wanted him dead. I wanted him to die in agony, to go mad, to rot
    alive. Do you know why?\u201D\r\n\tGeralt remained silent.\r\n\t\u201CI loved
    Adda. The king\u2019s sister. The king\u2019s mistress. The king\u2019s trollop.
    I loved her\u2014Witcher, are you there?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI am.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI
    know what you\u2019re thinking. But it wasn\u2019t like that. Believe me, I didn\u2019t
    cast any spells. I don\u2019t know anything about magic. Only once in anger did
    I say\u2026 Only once. Witcher? Are you listening? It\u2019s his mother, the old
    queen. It must be her. She couldn\u2019t watch him and Adda\u2014It wasn\u2019t
    me. I only once, you know, tried to persuade them but Adda \u2014 Witcher! I was
    besotted, and said\u2026 Witcher? Was it me? Me?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CIt doesn\u2019t
    matter anymore.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWitcher? Let me go. Have mercy, I beg you.\u201D\r\n\n\t1.
    Use Ostrit as bait\n\t2. Let him go"
