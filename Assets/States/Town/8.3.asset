  storyText: "\tVelerad leaned back in his chair, locked his hands over his stomach.\r\n\t\u201CShortly
    after his coronation Foltest got his own sister with child. Adda was younger and
    they were always together, but nobody suspected anything except, perhaps, the
    queen\u2026 Adda gave birth. And now listen, because this is where it all starts.
    Only a few saw what she bore, but one midwife jumped from the tower window to
    her death and the other lost her senses and remains dazed to this day. Royal bastard
    \u2014 a girl \u2014died immediately. So did Adda.\r\n\t\u201CFor seven years
    after the funeral there was peace. Then one night \u2014 it was a full moon \u2014
    there were screams in the palace, shouting and commotion! I don\u2019t have to
    tell you, this is your trade and you\u2019ve read the proclamation. The infant
    had grown in the coffin \u2014 and how! \u2014 grown to have incredible teeth!
    In a word, she became a striga.\r\n\t\u201CFoltest summoned a whole crowd of sorcerers.
    One suggested burning the striga together with the palace and the sarcophagus.
    Another advised chopping her head off. The rest were keen on driving aspen stakes
    into her body during the day, when the she-devil was asleep in her coffin. Unfortunately
    one, a jester with a pointed hat and a bald pate, a hunchbacked hermit, argued
    it was magic: the spell could be undone and the striga would turn into Foltest\u2019s
    little daughter, as pretty as a picture. Someone simply had to stay in the crypt
    throughout the night, and that would be that. After which \u2014 can you imagine
    such a fool? \u2014 he went to the palace for the night. Little of him was left
    in the morning. But Foltest clung to his idea like a burr to a dog\u2019s tail.
    He forbade any attempt to kill the striga and brought in charlatans from all corners
    of Wyzim to reverse the spell and turn her into a princess.\r\n\t\u201CSo it\u2019s
    been for seven years, Geralt. Foltest\u2019s promised reward, the three thousand,
    has attracted any number of cranks, stray knights, even a shepherd known throughout
    the whole region as a cretin, may he rest in peace. But the striga is still doing
    well. And at least those heroes trying to reverse the spell have a use \u2014
    the beast stuffs herself on the spot and doesn\u2019t roam beyond her palace.
    Foltest has a new palace, of course, quite a fine one.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhich
    way to the palace? The new one?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll take you there myself.\u201D\r"
