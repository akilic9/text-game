    forget about the betrothal,\u201D Velerad mocked. \u201CWhat are you talking about?
    It\u2019s obvious you won\u2019t get the money king is offering.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHow\u2019s
    it obvious?\u201D\r\n\tVelerad thumped the table. \u201CGeralt, do not spoil my
    impression of witchers! This has been going on for more than seven years! The
    striga is finishing off up to fifty people a year, fewer now people are avoiding
    the palace. All this nonsense about lifting the spell was made up by a hunchbacked,
    snotty old man who\u2019d lost his mind on his hermit\u2019s diet. It\u2019s nonsense
    which no one but Foltest believes. Adda gave birth to a striga because she slept
    with her brother. That is the truth, and no spell will help. Now the striga devours
    people\u2014as strigas do\u2014she has to be killed, and that is that. Listen:
    two years ago peasants from some godforsaken hole near Mahakam were plagued by
    a dragon devouring their sheep. They set out together, battered the dragon to
    death with stanchions, and did not even think it worth boasting about. But we
    in Wyzim are waiting for a miracle and bolting our doors every full moon, or tying
    our criminals to a stake in front of the palace, praying the beast stuffs herself
    and returns to her sarcophagus.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNot a bad method.\u201D The witcher
    smiled. \u201CAre there fewer criminals?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNot a bit of it. Think
    about the offer again Geralt.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo. I have already made a deal
    with the king. And sometimes it\u2019s easier to lift a spell than to kill.\u201D\r"
