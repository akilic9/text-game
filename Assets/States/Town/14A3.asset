  storyText: "\tTo gain time Geralt jumped on to the stairs leading to the gallery.
    He had not even climbed halfway up when the striga ran out of the crypt, speeding
    along like an enormous black spider. The witcher waited until she had run up the
    stairs after him, then leapt over the balustrade. The striga turned on the stairs,
    sprang and flew at him in an amazing ten-meter leap. She did not let herself be
    deceived by his pirouettes this time; twice her talons left their mark on the
    Rivian\u2019s leather tunic.\r\n\tGeralt kept trying to gain more time. He tried
    everything but the striga, fueled by uncontrolled anger, lust for blood and a
    never-ending hunger was too strong. Standing tired, he wished he hadn\u2019t let
    Ostrit go.\r\nStriga leapt. She swiped him across the neck with her talons, cutting
    him deeply. Blood splashed onto her face. She howled, striking him in the eyes
    with her other hand. He butted her in the face with his forehead, she threw him
    to the wall.\r\n\tThe witcher got up with difficulty. His blood was draining away
    quickly. He made a move toward the stairs but staggered and sat down heavily on
    the floor. Blood was pouring through the drenched canvas onto his hands, running
    down his sleeve. He saw the black shape in corner of his eye. She knew the witcher
    didn\u2019t have much time. She approached slowly, opening her teeth wide to devour
    him.\r\n\tHer teeth was the last thing the witcher saw.\n\tIn Wyzim, beyond the
    lake, a cock, ruffling his feathers in the cold damp, crowed hoarsely for the
    third time.\r\n"
