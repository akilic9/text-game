  storyText: "\t\u201CI would like to hear a description of the\u2026 the princess.\u201D\r\n\tVelerad
    leapt up from his chair. \u201CThe princess looks like a striga!\u201D he yelled.
    \u201CLike the most strigish striga I have heard of! Her Royal Highness, the cursed
    royal bastard, is four cubits high, shaped like a barrel of beer, has a maw which
    stretches from ear to ear and is full of dagger-like teeth, has red eyes and a
    red mop of hair! Her paws, with claws like a wild cat\u2019s, hang down to the
    ground! I\u2019m surprised we\u2019ve yet to send her likeness to friendly courts!
    The princess, plague choke her, is already fourteen. Time to think of giving her
    hand to a prince in marriage!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHold on, Velerad.\u201D Ostrit
    frowned, glancing at the door. Segelin smiled faintly.\r\n\t\u201CThe description,
    although vivid, is reasonably accurate, and that\u2019s what you wanted, isn\u2019t
    it, witcher? Velerad didn\u2019t mention that the princess moves with incredible
    speed and is far stronger for her height and build than one would expect. And
    she is fourteen years old, if that is of any importance.\u201D\r\n\n\t1. \"Did
    the sorcerers think the spell could be lifted?\"\n\t2. \"Time of her attacks...\"\n\t3.
    \"Anyone survived an attack?\"\n\t4. \"Other witchers?\"\n\t5. \"I've learned
    enough.\""
